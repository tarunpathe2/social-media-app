I have decided to make a User model and a Post model then to establish the relation between them and to fetch the values of user to post so that we are able to see the posts of a particular user, post the posts for particular user and also to access other users post. till now I have made the User and Post Model and established the relationship between them, Im trying to access the user from post.
